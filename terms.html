    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 16, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>🚀 Summary</h3>
        <p>By using Listee, you agree to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tool Purpose:</strong> Listee is an automation tool designed to help you organize and relist your own Vinted inventory.</li>
            <li><strong>Independence:</strong> We are <strong>not</strong> affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Vinted in any way.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for your own account safety. While we build safety features (like "Delete-First"), we are not liable for account suspensions or bans.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By installing the Listee Chrome Extension ("the Service") or purchasing a subscription, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please uninstall the extension immediately.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Listee provides automation features to assist sellers on the Vinted platform. Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Copying item details (Title, Description, Photos) from an existing page.</li>
        <li>Deleting the old listing automatically before creating a new one (to prevent duplicate content).</li>
        <li>Facilitating the transfer of data to a new listing form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Account & Safety</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 Account Bans & Liability</h3>
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Vinted’s Terms of Service generally discourage the use of third-party automation tools.
    </div>
    <p>While Listee includes safety measures (such as the "Delete First, Then Relist" logic) to mimic human behavior and avoid duplicate item flags, <strong>we cannot guarantee that your account will never be flagged or banned.</strong></p>
    <p>By using Listee, you acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You use the software at your own risk.</li>
        <li>Listee is not liable for any account suspensions, bans, or loss of income resulting from the use of our tool.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for adhering to Vinted's own Community Guidelines and Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    
    <h3>4.1 Payment Processing</h3>
    <p>All payments are processed securely via <strong>Stripe</strong>. Listee does not store your payment card details.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>Since Listee offers a free trial (1 free relist per day) for you to test the software before buying, <strong>refunds are generally not provided</strong> for "change of mind."</p>
    <p>However, if the tool is technically broken for you and our support team cannot fix it, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@uselistee.com">support@uselistee.com</a> within 14 days of purchase, and we will review your request.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Lifetime Access</h3>
    <p>"Lifetime Access" refers to the lifetime of the product. If Listee is discontinued, we will aim to provide at least 3 months' notice, but no refunds will be issued for the lifetime license after 12 months of use.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The "Listee" name, logo, and code are the intellectual property of the Listee Team. You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to copy the source code of the extension.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.</p>

    <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom.</p>
